      <h2 className="text-xl font-semibold mb-4 text-[#9B4DCA]">What is EMI?</h2>
      <p className="mb-6 text-base text-gray-300">
        EMI refers to the fixed monthly payment you make toward repaying your
        loan. Each EMI consists of both principal and interest components, which
        can vary depending on the loan structure. Our calculator helps you
        understand how much of your monthly payment goes toward interest versus
        paying down the principal.
